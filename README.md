## Inversoft Client Library Savant Plugin ![semver 2.0.0 compliant](http://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

This provides objects to the freemarker engine, which turns them into language specific client libraries.

* `apis`. A list of all the json objects pulled from the `src/main/api` directory.
* `domain`. A list of all the json objects pulled from the `src/main/domain` directory. These are generated by the [java2json](https://github.com/inversoft/java2json/) but are checked into the client builder project.
* `camel_to_underscores`. This is a [groovy helper object](https://github.com/inversoft/client-library-plugin/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/inversoft/savant/plugin/clientLibrary/CamelToUnderscores.groovy) for converting strings from `camelCase` to `snake_case`.
* `endpoints`. This is a map of maps of maps of json objects. `endpoints` is the top level object. Below that is the api endpoint, such as `/api/login`. Below that is a map with the keys of the various methods available for this endpoint. The values of that map are the json objects pulled from the `src/main/api` directory.
